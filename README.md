## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **ASP.NET MVC** (C#)
- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **Entity Framework**

### AI & Microservices
- **FastAPI** (Python)
- **Swagger** for API documentation
- **Trained ML Models** for recommendation and expense analysis

### Frontend
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **jQuery**
- **Bootstrap** for responsive design
- **Flutter** (for mobile application)

## System Architecture

- ASP.NET MVC handles web routing, business logic, and role-based authorization.
- SQL Server manages structured e-commerce data with stored procedures.
- FastAPI services run independently and are consumed via HTTP REST APIs.
- Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) dynamically interacts with APIs using AJAX.
- Mobile app communicates with backend via RESTful APIs.
